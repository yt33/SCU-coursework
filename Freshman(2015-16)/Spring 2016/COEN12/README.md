COEN 12: Abstract Data Types & Structures

Data abstraction: abstract data types, information hiding, interface specification. Basic data structures: stacks, queues, lists, binary trees, hashing, tables, graphs; implementation of abstract data types in the C language. Internal sorting: review of selection, insertion, and exchange sorts; quicksort, heapsort; recursion. Analysis of run-time behavior of algorithms; Big-O notation. Introduction to classes in C++.

lab assignments

lab1 (count words): count the number of words in a text file

lab2 (Set ADT): implemenet a Set Abstract Data Type (ADT) with sorted and unsorted arrays

lab3 (Hash ADT): implemenet a Set ADT with a Hash Table with Linear Probing

lab4 (Linked Hash Table): implement a Set ADT with hashing by chaining

lab5 (Huffman Queue): implement Priority Queue ADT with array representation of Heap and use heap ideas for Huffman coding

lab6 (QuickSort): implement Set ADT with Hash Table with Linear Probing; returns sorted list (different from lab4); use QuickSort algorithm
