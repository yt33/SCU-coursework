 * Description: This file contains the main function for testing a set
 *              abstract data type for strings.
 *
 *              The program takes two files as command line arguments, the
 *              second of which is optional.  All words in the first file
 *              are inserted into the set and the counts of total words and
 *              total words in the set are printed.  If the second file is
 *              given then all words in the second file are deleted from
 *              the set and the count printed.
