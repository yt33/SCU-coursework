Description: This file contains the answers to the questions of Lab 1 and some observation.

C Program with two processes
Step 4a: I notice different command lines cause the difference in running time of the program
	fastest ./s1 500
			./s1 3000
	slowest	./s1 5000

Step 5: The output of using 2 threads is the same as the output of using 2 processes.
We are just implementing it in a different way.
In order to do it with 2 threads, we only keep one of the child process and the parent process
