Title: README
Description: Brief introduction of the "flow" of different parts and bbservation 
	of Lab3 on programming UDP/IP and TCP/IP socket.

Part1: Copy a binary/text file to another file
part1.c

Part2: Client-Server with UDP/IP and TCP/IP
Step3: observation
When I run the server first as a background process, and then run the client, I see that
the UDP client and server communicate: any character or string I enter from the client side will 
show up in the server side.
For string separated by " ", it will be passed in 2 separate command.
When I enter "q" or "Q" on the client side, both the client and server terminate.

Step4: client.c and server.c

Step5: udpc.c and udps.c

Step6: tcpc.c and tcps.c
