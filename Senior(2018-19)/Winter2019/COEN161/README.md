lab 10: To-do application (cont.)
- The file system where you were storing your saved sessions computed and you lose all your data. Your incident analyst recommends you use a database table to store your to-dos (as if you didn't have enough to do). Most of the application is already updated to support the database but you are tasked with completing the module, nodeTodoDb, which will connect to the database and execute queries to read to-dos for a given session id and insert new to-dos into the table.
