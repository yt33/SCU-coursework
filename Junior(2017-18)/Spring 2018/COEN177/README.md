COEN177: Operating Systems

Introduction to computer operating systems. Operating system concepts, computer organization model, storage hierarchy, operating system organization, processes management, interprocess communication and synchronization, memory management and virtual memory, I/O subsystems, and file systems. Design, implementation, and performance issues. 

lab assignments (C)

assignment1: 
(1) write a simple shell program. The Shell should terminate if the user enters "exit" at the command line, and should attempt to launch a program in response to any other input string
(2) write a program that creates exactly 8 child processes
(3) write a program that will result in a total of 12 child processes to run when launched
(4) write a program that will result in a total of 17 child processes to run when launched

assignment2: Minix scheduling
(1) find the source file in the minix source code that prints the copy right message upon boot
(2) Using the Minix 3 operating system, running under vmware, you are to modify the queue selection algorithm to skew the priority scheduling

assignment3: investigate the performance of a computer's file system
This is intended to help give perspective on I/O speed before we start tackling that material in the main course. The question we are attempting to answer could be described as: "How quickly can a file system handle requests from a user process?" This is rather vague, so specificall, you are expected to offer an answer for one question: "What is the impact of user workload on the file system performance?"

assignment4: write programs that simulate page replacement algorithms: FIFO, LRU, and Second Chance Page Replacement
