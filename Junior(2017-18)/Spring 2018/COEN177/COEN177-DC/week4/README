The original scheduler pick_proc is simple. It executes the queue with the highest priority first, and goes down in order, so queue with processes are executed in the order of priority.

The modified scheduler is different. In the for loop, I add an if statement which randomly pick a queue with lower priority and execute it after finishing the current queue. In this way, the queue is not executed in the order of priority, but the randomness involved. As a result, it changed the original order. Everytime a queue is executed, there is a possibility of 0.5 (50/100) that a queue with lower priority will cut into the line. In this ay, the booting process of minix should be way slower than before, so I timed the boot time. If the new boot time is longer than an unmodified minix, then the new scheduler works.

In the test, it takes about 50 sec for the system to boot after the modification.
