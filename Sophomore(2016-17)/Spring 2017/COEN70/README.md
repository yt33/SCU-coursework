COEN 70: Formal Specification and Advanced Data Structures

lab assignments:

lab1: Getting familiar with C++

Project1:

(1) "statistician" class: After a sequence has been given to a statistician, obtain information about the sequence

(2) "RandGen" class: Design and implement a class that can generate a sequence of pseudorandom integers, which is a sequence that appears random in many ways. The approach uses the linear congruence method

Project2:

(1) update "statistician" class

(2) implement "bag" class

Project3:

Implement the "sequence" class. A "sequence" class is similar to a bag, both obtain a bunch of items, but unlike a bag, the items in a sequence are arranged in an order. In contrast to the "bag" class, the member functions of a sequence will allow a program to step through the sequence one item at a time.

Project4:

(1) Specify, design, and implement a class for "polynomials"

(2) Specify, design, and implement the "polynomials" class using a dynamic array

Project5:
Complete the implementation for a simplified version of the Standard Library "string" class

Project6:
Implement the "sequence" class using linked list. We'll keep the items stored in a linked list, in their sequence order.

Project7:
Start with your "sequence" class that uses a linked list to store the items. Then, convert this class, as well as the "node" class, to be template classes.

Project8:
Implement and test a "PriorityQueue" class, where the items of the priority queue are stored on the linked list

Project9:
Implement a binary tree
