COEN 21: Introduction to Logic Design

Boolean functions and their minimization. Designing combinational circuits, adders, multipliers, multiplexers, decoders. Noise margin, propagation delay. Bussing. Memory elements: latches and flip-flops; timing; registers; counters. Programmable logic, PLD, and FPGA. Use of industry quality CAD tools for schematic capture and HDL in conjunction with FPGAs. Also listed as ELEN 21.

lab assignments:

lab1: Introduction to logic gates
- Learn how to work with the breadboard and connected sensors, output componenets, and integrated circuits (chips) with logic gates
- Translate a problem statement into a logic circuit
- Design, test, and implement a logic circuit based on a functional specification
- Explore simple logic circuits implemented with standard logic chips

lab2: Design capture and simualtion
- Familiarize with the Altera Quartus II design program
- Design a schematic, and simulate the circuit in the Altera Quartus II design program
- Download the designed circuit onto the ALtera FPGA and test your circuit on the FPGA

lab3: Two level circuit design
- Design, test, and implement a circuit based on a functional specification
- Translate a problem into an algebraic representation
- Simplify the algebraic representation using Kmap to find the minimized logic implementation
- Implement and test the circuit on an Altera FPGA

lab4: Multiplexer design
- Design and use a multiplexer as:
  - a switch to connect different inputs to single wire
  - a building block for logic circuits
  
lab5: 4-bit ripple-carry adder
- Do hierarchical design and create symbols for circuits to be used as building blocks
- Use busses for multi-bit inputs such as numbers and ASCII characters
- Design a 4-bit ripple-carry adder using half adders and full adders as building blocks
- Use 7-segment displays to show inputs and outputs of the design, and add a Verilog module to generate the 7-segment display

lab6: Mini-calculator with small arithmetic logic unit (ALU)
- Design and test a small adder/subtractor/logic unit (ALU)
- Use your ALU in a mini-calculator with one memory location

lab7: Slot machine inspired game
- Use the design wizard to create logic components
- Use a comparator and a counter in a circuit
- Use a multiplexer to switch multi-bit input

lab8: Counters
- Use D-type flip-flops to build both a ripple counter and a synchronous counter
- Use a decoder to full decode a counter's outputs into individual count indicators

lab9: Registers
- Use flip-flops to build a register
- Use multiplexers to design a multi-funciton shift register
